# Figures and Latex source files for the manuscript

The `Makefile` has rules for building the PDF of the manuscript. To build the
PDF, run:

    make

To estimate the number of words in the paper (useful for estimating number of
pages):

    make wc

The compiled paper is placed in the `output` folder.

You can also run `proselint` (a grammar checker) on manuscript.tex with:

  make proselint

*It's also a good idea to mention here what notebook generated the figures in
the `figures` folder.*
