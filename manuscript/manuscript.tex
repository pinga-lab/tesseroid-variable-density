\begin{summary}
We present a new open-soruce software that computes the gravitational fields generated by any tesseroid whose density varies arbitrarily in depth, i.e. a forward gravity model in spherical coordinates for varying densities on the radial direction.
It is written in Python and Cython language and is compatible with the classes and functions of the library for geophysical modelling Fatiando a Terra.
It numerically approximates the gravitational fields by applying the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature along with a preexisting adaptive discretization algorithm and a new density-based discretization algorithm that control both the accuracy and the computation time of the forward model.
The first algorithm is regulated by a predefined scalar called distance-size ratio ($D$) and reduces the errors due to the distance between the tesseroid and the computation point.
While the second one, controlled by a delta ratio ($\delta$), decreases the errors introduced by the variation of the density function.
We have also obtained analytical solutions for a spherical shell with variable density and compared them with the results of the numerical model in case of a linear, an exponential and a discontinuous density function.
These comparisons allowed to obtain default values for the distance-size and the delta ratio in order to guarantee the accuracy of the forward model.
The resulting optimal values of $D$ for the gravity potential, the components of its gradient and the Marussi tensor components are 1, 2 and 8, respectively.
While a $\delta=0.2$ is needed in the computation of every gravity field, guaranteeing the accuracy even for high varying exponential densities and discontinuous functions.
We have finally tested the new software by modelling the Neuqu\'en sedimentary basin, located to the east of the Andes between 32$^\circ$S and 40$^\circ$S latitude, assigning an exponential density variation to it and computing all the gravity fields it generates.

\section{Introduction}

Lithosphere's density variation with depth has been studied for almost a century. 
On the first years \citet{Athy1930} obtained a decreasing exponential relation between both quantities by studying shale samples, while in the following decades other density functions have been proposed for different rock types \citep[e.g.,][]{Maxant1980, Rao1986, Rao1993, Rao1994}.
Furthermore, varying densities have been taken into account in forward and inversion gravity models, mostly applied to grabens and basins \citep{Cordell1973, Rao1986, Cowie1990, Rao1993, Rao1994, Zhang2001, Welford2010}.

These forward gravity models have been developed for two or three dimensional bodies in cartesian coordinates that properly fit local scales applications.
Nevertheless, the latest satellite missions have provided us gravity measurements with global coverage, which allow geologists and geophysics to perform modelling and interpretation on regional scales.
This raises the importance of building forward models that reproduce the gravity anomalies for such scales.

The main issue that should be overcome is to take into account the curvature of the Earth, thus the forward model must be defined in spherical coordinates.
A common way to achieve this is to discretize the Earth in spherical prisms known as tesseroids, which are defined by pairs of latitude, longitude and radial boundaries (see Figure \ref{fig:tesseroid-uieda}).
The calculation of the gravity fields generated by an arbitrary tesseroid on any external point involves the resolution of volume integrals that are generally approximated by numerical computations.
The literature offers two approaches: one involves Taylor series expansion \citep{Heck2007, Grombein2013} while the other makes use of Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ) \citep{Asgharzadeh2007, Uieda2016, Uieda2017}.

In order to develop a forward model that computes the gravity field generated by any tesseroid with arbitrary variable density, the Taylor series expansion is not well suited, because it would need the series expansion terms for each density function.
On the other hand, the GLQ consists in approximating the integral by a weighted sum of the effect of point masses located at scaled nodes of the Legendre polynomials, where the density variation is summarised into the weights.
Thus, this kind of numerical approximation allows to calculate the gravity fields for any density function without any other information but the function itself.

\label{fig:tesseroid-uieda}
\end{figure}

\citet{Uieda2016} developed a forward gravity model based on tesseroids with homogeneous densities using the GLQ approximation method.
It has been originally implemented through command line programs written in C programming language.
However, it has been ultimately ported to Python and included in the open-source library Fatiando a Terra \citep{Uieda2013} for geophysical modelling and inversion.

\citet{Ku1977} proved that the GLQ becomes less accurate when the computation point is closer to the tesseroid or for smaller GLQ order. 
Although the model developed by \citet{Uieda2016} uses a second order GLQ, it ensures the accuracy implementing a modified version of the adaptive discretization of \citet{Li2011}.
It consist in splitting the tesseroid into smaller ones when a certain distance-size ratio is lower than a predefined value ($D$) that controls the accuracy of the computation. 
\citet{Uieda2016} have also objectively obtained standard values of $D$ for gravity potential, gradients and tensor components comparing the numerical model with the fields generated by a spherical shell, which constitutes a special case of the volume integrals that has analytical solution \citep{LaFehr1991, Mikuska2006, Grombein2013}\todo{citar mas??}.

In addition, a varying density inside an arbitrary tesseroid introduces a new kind of error into the numerical approximation.
This encouraged us to develop a new density-based discretization algorithm that divides the tesseroid into smaller ones taking into account the variation of the density function.
The number of subdivisions and thus the accuracy of the approximation will be controlled by a delta ratio $\delta$, predefined by the user.

We have enhanced the implementation of \citet{Uieda2016} with a new forward gravity model that allows to compute the gravity fields generated by any tesseroid with an arbitrary density function on any external point.
It is based on the GLQ approximation, makes use of the modified distance-size discretization and the new density-based discretization algorithms that guarantee the accuracy even for high varying density functions.
It is written in Python and Cython languages, constituting an easy to use library that runs precompiled code for the more time consuming functions.
It also makes use of some previously existing classes and functions from Fatiando a Terra, what saved us time and allowed us to focus on the new enhancements.
Furthermore, we have the intention to include it into a future release of the Fatiando a Terra library in order to make its distribution and maintenance easier.

In order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical approximation, we have conducted similar tests as the one performed by \citet{Uieda2016} by comparing the results of the numerical model with the analytical solutions for a spherical shell with linear, exponential and discontinuous density.
Furthermore we had to derive the analytical expressions for these density functions.

In the following sections we will describe how the new algorithm works, its theoretical background and obtain default distance-size ratio and delta ratio values needed to get an acceptable accuracy in the numerical approximation.

\section{Theory}

The spherical prisms known as tesseroids are mass elements defined in a geocentric spherical coordinate system bounded by a pair of parallels, a pair of  meridians, and two concentric spherical surfaces.
We define an external computation point $P(r, \phi, \lambda)$ where the gravity fields generated by the tesseroid are going to be calculated with respect to the local north oriented Cartesian coordinate system located at $P$.
In the special case of homogeneous density, the gravity potential, its gradient and the Marussi tensor components can be calculated through the integrals obtained by \citet{Grombein2013} \citep[for same notation as the one we will use, see][]{Uieda2016}.

In our case, we will assume that the tesseroid has an arbitrary variable density in depth, i.e. only depends on the radial spherical coordinate.
Thus, the integrals for the gravity fields are slightly modified:

\begin{equation}
    V(r,\phi,\lambda) = G
    \int\limits_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}
    \int\limits_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2}
    \int\limits_{r_1}^{r_2}
    \frac{\rho(r')}{\ell} \kappa \,  dr' d\phi' d\lambda',
\label{eq:tesseroid-pot}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    g_{\alpha}(r,\phi,\lambda) = G
    \int\limits_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}
    \int\limits_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2}
    \int\limits_{r_1}^{r_2}
    \rho(r') \frac{\Delta_\alpha}{\ell^3}
    \kappa \, dr' d\phi' d\lambda',
\label{eq:tesseroid-grav}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    g_{\alpha\beta}(r,\phi,\lambda) = G
    \int\limits_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}
    \int\limits_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2}
    \int\limits_{r_1}^{r_2}
    \rho(r') I_{\alpha\beta} \, \kappa \, dr' d\phi' d\lambda' ,
    \label{eq:tesseroid-tensor}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
    I_{\alpha\beta} =
    \left(
        \frac{3\Delta_{\alpha} \Delta_{\beta}}{\ell^5} -
        \frac{\delta_{\alpha\beta}}{\ell^3}
    \right) ,
    \label{eq:tesseroid-tensor-kernel}
\end{equation}

\noindent $\alpha, \beta \in \{x, y, z\}$,
$\rho(r')$ is the density function that depends on the radial coordinate,
$\delta_{\alpha\beta}$ is Kronecker's delta,
$G = 6.674\times10^{-11}\, \text{m$^3$kg$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$}$ is the gravitational constant and

\begin{equation}
    \Delta_x = r'[\cos\phi\sin\phi' - \sin\phi\cos\phi'
               \cos(\lambda' - \lambda)],
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_y = r' \cos \phi' \sin(\lambda' - \lambda),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_z = r' \cos \psi - r,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \kappa = {r'}^2 \cos \phi',
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \ell = \sqrt{{r'}^2 + r^2 - 2 r r' \cos \psi},
\label{eq:ell}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \cos\psi = \sin\phi\sin\phi' + \cos\phi\cos\phi'
                 \cos(\lambda' - \lambda).
\label{eq:cospsi}
\end{equation}


According to \citet[p.~390]{Hildebrand1987}, we can approximate any integral in the interval $[-1, 1]$ using a $N$th order GLQ, i.e. by a weighted sum of the integration kernel evaluated on the roots of the $N$th Legendre polynomial:

\begin{equation}
    \int\limits_{-1}^1 f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^N W_i f(x_i),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x_i$ are the roots of the $N$th Legendre polynomial $P_N(x)$ and $W_i$ are the weights of each term:

\begin{equation}
    W_i = \frac{2}{(1-x_i^2)[P_N^\prime(x_i)]^2},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    P_N(x_i) = 0, \quad \forall i = {1,\dots,N}.
\end{equation}

In case of an integration defined on a arbitrary interval, e.g. $[a,b]$, we can scale the nodes and perform a similar approximation:

\begin{equation}
    \int\limits_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{b-a}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N W_i f(x_i^s),
\label{eq:glq-scaled}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x_i^s$ is the scaled $x_i$ root into the $[a,b]$ interval, also called nodes of the quadrature:

\begin{equation}
    x_i^s = \frac{b-a}{2} x_i + \frac{b+a}{2}.
\end{equation}

\noindent For example, if we use a second order GLQ, the roots of the $P_2(x)$ Legendre polynomial and its corresponding weights are $x_i = \pm 0.577350269$ and $W_i = 1$.

Our intention is to use GLQ to approximate the volume integrals from equations \ref{eq:tesseroid-pot}-\ref{eq:tesseroid-tensor}. 
When tesseroids have variable densities, we can write the integral kernels as the product of a certain function $g$ and the density function:

\begin{equation}
    f(r', \phi', \lambda') = \rho(r') g(r', \phi', \lambda'),
\end{equation}

\noindent and then apply the quadrature to every integral corresponding to each spherical coordinate, obtaining a similar expression to the one shown by \citet{Asgharzadeh2007} and \citet{Uieda2016}:

\iftwocol{
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \iiint\limits_\Omega \rho(r') g(r', \phi', \lambda') 
        d\Omega \approx& \\
        A 
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N^r}
        \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N^\phi}
        \sum\limits_{k=1}^{N^\lambda}
        & W_i^r W_j^\phi W_k^\lambda \rho(r_i) g(r_i, \phi_j, \lambda_k),
    \end{split}
\label{eq:glq-var-dens}
\end{equation}
}{
\begin{equation}
    \iiint\limits_\Omega \rho(r') g(r', \phi', \lambda') d\Omega \approx
    A 
    \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N^r}
    \sum\limits_{j=1}^{N^\phi}
    \sum\limits_{k=1}^{N^\lambda}
    W_i^r W_j^\phi W_k^\lambda \rho(r_i) g(r_i, \phi_j, \lambda_k),
\label{eq:glq-var-dens}
\end{equation}
}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
    A = 
    \frac{(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)(\phi_2 - \phi_1)(r_2 - r_1)}{8}.
\end{equation}

From equation \ref{eq:glq-var-dens} we can observe that the GLQ approximates the gravity fields of a tesseroid as the ones generated by $N_\lambda N_\phi N_r$ point masses located at the nodes of the Legendre polynomials, where $N_i$ are the orders of the quadrature for each integration, with $i \in \{ \lambda, \phi, r \}$, in the same way as the GLQ works in the homogeneous density case.
Nevertheless, in this new variable density scenario, the information of the density function is summarised into the weights by taking into account only the values it assumes on those nodes.
Although this may sound discouraging, we intent to prove otherwise and show that this method, along with well suited discretization algorithms, approximates the gravity fields with good accuracy.\todo{no se si poner esta ultima oracion}


\subsection{Analytical Solutions for Spherical Shell}

The integrals that define the gravity fields in equations \ref{eq:tesseroid-pot}-\ref{eq:tesseroid-tensor} have analytical solutions for the exceptional case of a spherical shell with homogeneous density \citep{Mikuska2006,Grombein2013}.
In order to test the accuracy of their approximations, \citet{Uieda2016} and \citet{Grombein2013} compared their numerical models (tesseroids with homogeneous density) with these analytical solutions.

In case of variable density tesseroids, the comparison must obviously be made with a variable density spherical shell, whose analytical solution will depend on the chosen density function.
Because the literature has not offered it yet, we had to develop it ourselves. \todo{ no se si ponerlo asi}

Lets consider a spherical shell with inner and outer radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectivetly, whose density depends on the radial spherical coordinate (Figure \ref{fig:spherical-shell}).
The gravity potential generated by the shell on an arbitrary external point $Q(0,0,r)$, located along the $z$ axe at a distance $r$ from the origin, can be written as follows:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/spherical-shell.pdf}
\caption{
Spherical shell with inner and outer radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, respectively.
The computation point $Q$ is located on the $z$ axe at a distance $r$ from the centre of the shell.
For our purposes we will assume that $Q$ is outside the outer radii, i.e. $r > R_2$.
}
\label{fig:spherical-shell}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = G 
    \int\limits_0^{2\pi}
    \int\limits_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^\frac{\pi}{2}
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
    \frac{\rho(r')}{\ell} {r'}^2 \cos\phi' \, 
    dr' d\phi' d\lambda',
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\ell$ is defined in equation \ref{eq:ell}.
The computation point $Q$ is located at latitude $\phi=90^\circ$, so $\ell$ and $\cos\psi$ (defined in equation \ref{eq:cospsi}) get simplified:

\begin{equation}
    \cos\psi = \sin\phi', \quad
    \ell = \sqrt{r'^2 + r^2 - 2 r r' \sin\phi'}.
\end{equation}

Due to the rotational symmetry along the $z$ axe, the integration in $\lambda'$ is straightforward:

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = 2\pi G 
    \int\limits_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^\frac{\pi}{2}
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
    \frac{\rho(r') {r'}^2 \cos\phi'}{\sqrt{r'^2 + r^2 - 2 r r' \sin\phi'}}
    \, dr' d\phi',
\end{equation}

\noindent while the integration in $\phi'$ can be performed independently of the density function.
Making use of SymPy \citep{sympy2017}, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, we obtained the following expression for the potential:

\iftwocol{
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        V_\text{sh}(r) = 2\pi G
        \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
        \Big[ & \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 + 2rr'} - \\
        & \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'}
        \Big] \frac{r'\rho(r')}{r} \, dr'.
    \end{split}
\label{eq:shell-pot-sqrts}
\end{equation}
}{
\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = 2\pi G
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2}
    \Big[ \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 + 2rr'}  -
    \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'} 
    \Big] \frac{r'\rho(r')}{r} \, dr'.
\label{eq:shell-pot-sqrts}
\end{equation}
}

For our purposes we can assume that the computation point $Q$ is farther from the origin than the outer radius, i.e. $r>R_2$. 
And taking into account that $r'$ is always lower than $R_2$, we can simplify the square roots in equation \ref{eq:shell-pot-sqrts}:

\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 + 2rr'} = |r + r'| = r + r',
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{r^2 + r'^2 - 2rr'} = |r - r'| = r - r',
\end{equation}

\noindent what leads to the following expression of the potential:

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}(r) = \frac{4\pi G}{r}
    \int\limits_{R_1}^{R_2} {r'}^2 \rho(r') \, dr'.
\label{eq:shell-pot}
\end{equation}

The equation \ref{eq:shell-pot} allows to easily obtain the exact gravity potential generated by a spherical shell with a variable density in depth on any outside point located on the $z$ axe.
Due to the rotational symmetry along any axe that passes through the centre of the shell, the expression in equation \ref{eq:shell-pot} reproduces the gravity potential field on any outside point at distance $r$ from the its centre.

The gradient and the Marussi tensor derived from potentials that depends solely on $r$ have only a few non zero components: the vertical component of the gradient ($g_z$) and the diagonal components of the tensor ($g_{xx}$, $g_{yy}$, $g_{zz}$).
They can be easily obtained as \citet{Grombein2013} does, even for any arbitrary density function $\rho(r')$:

\begin{equation}
    g_z = \frac{V_\text{sh}(r)}{r},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    g_{xx} = g_{yy} = -\frac{V_\text{sh}(r)}{r^2}, \quad
    g_{zz} = \frac{2V_\text{sh}(r)}{r^2}.
\end{equation}

For future purposes we are going to obtain the gravity potential for three different functions from the perspective of their variation in $r'$: a linear and an exponential density function.


\subsubsection{Linear Density}

If the density of the spherical shell is a linear function on the radial coordinate, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = ar' + b,
\end{equation}

\noindent then the gravity potential generated on any computation point at distance $r$ from its centre can be obtained from the following expression:

\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}^\text{lin}(r) = \pi G \left[ 
    a \frac{R_2^4 - R_1^4}{r} +
    b \,\frac{4}{3} \frac{R_2^3 - R_1^3}{r} \right].
    \label{eq:shell-pot-linear}
\end{equation}

The first term on equation \ref{eq:shell-pot-linear} reproduces the potential generated by a spherical shell with variable density $\rho(r') = ar'$, while the second one constitutes the potential generated by a spherical shell with homogeneous density $\rho = b$ \citep{Mikuska2006,Grombein2013}.
So the potential can be read as the one generated by a combination of both shells.


\subsubsection{Exponential Density}

If, on the other hand, the spherical shell has an exponential density in the radial coordinate,

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = Ae^{-(r' - \Delta h)/b},
\end{equation}

\noindent the potential (calculated through SymPy \citep{sympy2017}) can be written as follows:

\iftwocol{
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        V_\text{sh}^\text{exp}(r) = \frac{4\pi G}{r} 
        Ab 
        \Big[
        & (R_1^2 + 2R_1 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_1 - \Delta h}{b}} - \\
        & (R_2^2 + 2R_2 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_2 - \Delta h}{b}}
        \Big].
    \end{split}
\label{eq:shell-pot-exp}
\end{equation}
}{
\begin{equation}
    V_\text{sh}^\text{exp}(r) = \frac{4\pi G}{r} 
    Ab \, e^\frac{\Delta h}{b}
    \Big[
    & (R_1^2 + 2R_1 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_1}{b}} - \\
    & (R_2^2 + 2R_2 b + 2b^2)e^{-\frac{R_2}{b}}
    \Big].
\label{eq:shell-pot-exp}
\end{equation}
}

\section{Implementation}

We have developed a Python library that computes the gravity fields generated by any Tesseroid with variable density in depth.
It is freely available under the BSD 3-clause open-source library and can be downloaded from the following repository: \todo{agregar repo, vale la pena poner el link?}

This new library approximates the gravitational effect of each tesseroid through the GLQ, and guarantees its accuracy with the modified version of the adaptive discretization algorithm, original developed by \citet{Li2011} and improved by \citet{Uieda2016}, and a new density-based discretization algorithm.
The later one had to be developed in order to decrease a new type of error in the numerical approximation caused by high variations in the density functions.

The new forward model is based on the preexisting code developed by \citet{Uieda2016} (and included in Fatiando a Terra v.0.5, \citet{Uieda2013}) that is able to compute the gravitational effects of tesseroids with homogeneous density.
On that implementation \citet{Uieda2016} have optimised the more time consuming functions through the Numba compiler.
In contrast, we have decided to develop our new library in Cython language due to difficulties when passing a Python function as argument to precompiled Numba methods, keeping the homogeneous tesseroid calculation and adding the new variable density computations.
The Cython language is a superset of Python language that allows to generate efficient C code through the Cython compiler, producing a library whose functions can be called from regular Python code.

Moreover, it is also compatible with the preexisting open-source library Fatiando a Terra and its usage is very similar to the one for homogeneous tesseroids:

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
    \item Define a single tesseroid (or a set of several tesseroids) with the Fatiando a Terra classes.
    \item Add a predefined Python density function to the tesseroid (or to each tesseroid in the set).
    \item Calculate the desired gravity field (potential, gradient or tensor components) on any set of computation points.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Modified Adaptive Discretization Algorithm}

From equation \ref{eq:glq-var-dens} we saw that the GLQ approximates the volume integrals as the gravitational effect of point masses located at the nodes of the quadrature.
If we set the GLQ orders to fixed values, it's easy to conclude that the nearer the computation point is to the tesseroid, the accuracy of the approximation is reduced and the point masses effect becomes more noticeable than the tesseroid we want to approximate.
A complete analysis of this conclusion can be found in \citet{Ku1977, Li2011, Uieda2016}.

Instead of increasing the GLQ orders to improve the accuracy, what leads to a more time consuming computation, adaptive discretization algorithms have been applied in previous works \citep{Li2011, Uieda2016}.
They essentially consist in dividing the tesseroid based on a ratio between the distance from its geometric centre to the computation point and its dimensions.

The main differences between the modified version made by \citet{Uieda2016} and the original one developed by \citet{Li2011} can be summed up in:
(1) a faster calculation of the distance from the computation point to the tesseroid and 
(2) the application of a stack based algorithm that speeds up the computation and gives more control over the recursion step.
More specifically, \citet{Uieda2016} redefined the dimensions of an arbitrary tesseroid: $L_\lambda$, $L_\phi$ and $L_r$. The former ones are the arc-distances measured along its top surface while $L_r$ is the difference between the radii of the top and bottom surfaces.

While keeping the GLQ fixed on second orders, the adaptive discretization algorithm starts by checking that the following inequality is satisfied:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{L_i} \geq D,
\label{eq:distance-size-ratio}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $i \in \{\lambda, \phi, r\}$, $d$ is the distance between the geometric centre of the tesseroid and the computation point, and $D$ is a predefined value called distance-size ratio.
If the inequality \ref{eq:distance-size-ratio} is not held for at least one spherical coordinate, then the tesseroid must be divided by half in that direction.
A complete description of the modified adaptive discretization algorithm can be found in \citet{Uieda2016}.
On the contrary, if the inequality is satisfied for every spherical coordinate, the algorithm computes the desired gravity field using the GLQ approximation.

In summary, the distance-size ratio $D$ determines indirectly how many times the tesseroids will be divided, and therefore efficiently regulates both the accuracy of the algorithm and its computation time.
Moreover, it limits the computation time by stopping the division of the tesseroids when their dimensions are lower than a certain value (1mm), assuming that such small tesseroids do not modifies significantly the desired gravitational field.

On the other hand, the value assigned to the distance-size ratio $D$ cannot be easily related to the error of the approximation, thus the choice of the value of $D$ to get an acceptable accuracy must be empirically determined beforehand.
In order to overcome this, \citet{Uieda2016} compared the numerical computation with the analytical solution for a spherical shell with homogeneous density.

We will perform similar tests, but now with variable density spherical shell.
From the infinite density functions that can be proposed, we have chosen three characteristic ones: a linear, an exponential and a discontinuous function.

\subsection{Density-based Discretization Algorithm}

High variations in the density function of an arbitrary tesseroid introduces a new type of error into the numerical approximation: only a few point masses would not reproduce the effect of this kind of variations.
The modified version of the adaptive discretization algorithm may help in reducing this kind of error, but as it only takes into account the dimensions of the tesseroid and the distance to the computation point, it's not well suited to fully perform this task.

In order to overcome this, we developed a complementary discretization algorithm that takes into account the variation of the density inside the tesseroid.
Basically, it subdivides any tesseroid on the radial direction on the depth at which the \emph{maximum density variation} takes place.

Specifically, the algorithm consists in the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
    \item Normalise the density function to the [0, 1] interval,
    \item Compute the absolute difference between the normalised density and a linear function that assumes the same values on the top and bottom radii that this normalised density.
    \item If the maximum of the absolute difference is greater that a predefined delta ratio ($\delta$), then the tesseroid will be subdivided on the radius at which this maximum takes place. Otherwise, the tesseroid won't be split.
\end{enumerate}

First we need to normalise the density function such as it assumes the values of 0 and 1 on the boundary radii ($R_1$, $R_2$), depending at which radius the original density function is maximum.
We call this normalised density $\rho_n(r')$ and we calculate it as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \rho_n(r') = \frac{\rho(r') - \rho_1}{\rho_2 - \rho_1},
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation}
    \rho_1 = \text{min}\{ \rho(R_1), \rho(R_2) \}, \quad
    \rho_2 = \text{max}\{ \rho(R_1), \rho(R_2) \}.
\end{equation}

Secondly, we must define a linear function $\rho_l(r')$ that assumes the same values as the normalised density $\rho_n(r')$ on the boundary radii:

\begin{equation}
    \rho_l(r') =
    \frac{ \rho_n(R_2) - \rho_n(R_1) }{ R_2 - R_1 } (r' - R_1) + \rho_n(R_1),
\end{equation}

\noindent and compute the absolute difference between this linear function and the normalised density:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta \rho (r') = | \rho_n(r') - \rho_l(r') |.
\end{equation}

Finally, if the maximum of the absolute difference if greater than a predefined delta ratio $\delta$ we will divide the tesseroid on the radius at which this maximum takes place ($R_\text{max}$):

\begin{equation}
    \text{max}\{ \Delta \rho(r') \} > \delta,
    \label{eq:delta-density}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{max}\{ \Delta \rho(r') \} = \Delta \rho(R_\text{max}),
\end{equation}

\noindent obtaining a pair of smaller tesseroids with the same longitude and latitude boundaries.

In case that the original density function assumes the same value at both boundary radii, the procedure is the same except that the constants $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are redefined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \rho_1 = \text{min}\{ \rho(r') \}, \quad
    \rho_2 = \text{max}\{ \rho(r') \}.
\end{equation}

If on the contrary the inequation \ref{eq:delta-density} is not held, then the tesseroid will not be subdivided.
The same happens if the density function is constant or if the tesseroid radial dimension is bellow the threshold of 1mm.
On the first case due to the fact that the density-based discretization algorithm is not needed, and on the second one because smaller tesseroids will not introduce meaningful increases in the accuracy of the computation.

This algorithm can be subsequently applied to every subdividing tesseroid, until the inequation \ref{eq:delta-density} is not held or the subdivisions are smaller than 1mm.
This two conditions guarantee that the algorithm is finite.
Once this conditions are met, every subdividing tesseroid is subjected to the modified adaptive discretization algorithm and the GLQ in order to compute the gravity field generated by it.

It's easy to see that the delta ratio indirectly controls how many times the tesseroids will be subdivided based on the variation of the density function.
Therefore it determines the accuracy involving the numerical error that the density variation introduces and also the computation time.
This raises the need to determine a maximum value of $\delta$ that ensures an acceptable accuracy while minimising the computation time.
We will perform this determination with the same methodology as the one applied to the $D$ ratio: compare the numerical model with the analytical solutions for a spherical shell.


\subsection{Algorithm summary}

When computing any gravity field generated by an arbitrary tesseroid on a specific computation point, the new software:

\begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand{\theenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
    \item Applies the density-based discretization algorithm in case of variable density producing subdivisions of the original tesseroid,
    \item Applies the modified adaptive discretization algorithm for each subdivision, generating a set of smaller tesseroids,
    \item Computes the desired gravity field for every small tesseroid through the GLQ approximation (equation \ref{eq:glq-var-dens}).
\end{enumerate}

These steps are applied for each computation point, adding the contribution of each tesseroid to the resulting gravity field.

\section{Determination of distance-size ratio}

In order to determine the minimum value for the distance-size ratio $D$ such the numerical approximation achieves an acceptable accuracy, we have compared the numerical model with the analytical solutions for a spherical shell with variable density for three special cases: a linear, an exponential and a discontinuous density function.
The first one constitutes the simplest variation, the second one represents a higher varying function, while the later one tries to emulate a contact between two different media (e.g. crust and mantle interface).

We approximated the spherical shell by a mesh of $30^\circ \times 30^\circ$ tesseroids and calculated the gravity potential, the vertical component of the gradient ($g_z$) and the diagonal components of the Marussi tensor ($g_{xx}$, $g_{yy}$, $g_{zz}$) on four different grids: (1) a grid located at the pole, (2) another one on the Equator, (3) one located at satellite height and (4) a big grid of $30^\circ \times 30^\circ$.
More information about this grids can be found on Table \ref{tab:grids}.

We computed these gravity fields on every point of the four grids for different values of $D$, ranging from 0.5 to 10 with a step of 0.5, without applying the density-based discretization algorithm in order to isolate the behaviour of the adaptive discretization one.
Then we calculated the maximum difference between these results and the value that the analytical solution assumes at the same height.

Because the gravity fields generated by a tesseroid are approximated by the effect of point masses, the numerical results may vary between computation points at same height but at different latitude or longitude.
That's why we choose for comparison the maximum difference between the results on every point of the grid and the analytical solution.

Finally, we set the acceptable value of $D$ if the corresponding error of the numerical approximation is lower than 0.1\%.

\begin{table}
\caption{
    Description of the synthetic grids on which the comparison of the numerical model against the analytical solutions for a spherical shell was done.

Every grid consists in a set of 10$\times$10 points.

    Satellite & $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ & $89^\circ - 90^\circ$ & $0^\circ - 1^\circ$ & 260km \\
    Big Grid & $30^\circ \times 30^\circ$ & $60^\circ - 90^\circ$ & $0^\circ - 30^\circ$ & 2km \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Linear Density}
Firstly,  we proposed a spherical shell with linear density in such way it assumes 2670~kg/m$^3$ on the surface of the Earth and 3300~kg/m$^3$ at the inner radius:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = ar' + c,
    \label{eq:density-linear}
\end{equation}
\noindent with 
\begin{equation}
    a = -\frac{3300\text{kg/m$^3$} - 2670\text{kg/m$^3$}}{R_2 - R_1},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    c = \frac{3300\text{kg/m$^3$} - 
        2670\text{kg/m$^3$}}{R_2 - R_1} R + 
        2670\text{kg/m$^3$},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R$ = 6378.137 km is the mean Earth radius.

Then we computed the difference between the numerical model with its corresponding analytical solution (equation \ref{eq:density-linear}) for a thick and a thin spherical shell of 1km and 35km of thickness, respectively.

We can see the results for the potential, the vertical component of the gradient $g_z$ and the $g_{zz}$ component of the Marussi tensor on Figures \ref{fig:D-linear-thin} and \ref{fig:D-linear-thick}.
We exclude the results corresponding to the other two diagonal components of the tensor because they are similar to the ones obtained for the $g_{zz}$, although they can be found on the repository. \todo{chequear}

For the linear density case, we can observe that the calculation of the potential and the $g_z$ component of its gradient needs a value of $D=1$ and $D=2$, respectively, in order to ensure an accuracy of 0.1\%.
On the other hand, the $g_{zz}$ computations show a noticeable difference between the thin and the thick shell: the first one needs a value of $D$ equal to 8 while the later only a $D$ of 3.5.
We will keep the more conservative result of $D$ equal to 8 in case of computing the Marussi tensor components in case of a linear density tesseroid.

If the difference is less than 0.1\%, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.

If the difference is less than 0.1\%, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.
}
\label{fig:D-linear-thick}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Exponential Density}

To test the model in case of an exponential density we proposed the following function:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = A e^{-(r' - R)/b} + C,
\label{eq:density-exp}
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation}
    A =
    (3300 \text{kg/m}^3 - 2670 \text{kg/m}^3)
    \left( e^{( R_2 - R_1 )/b} - 1 \right)^{-1},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    C =
    2670 \text{kg/m}^3 - A,
\end{equation}

\noindent and the value of $b$ equal to the thickness of the spherical shell we will use to perform the test.
In this way, the density function assumes the values of 2670 kg/m$^3$ and 3300 kg/m$^3$ on the shell's outer and inner radii, respectively.
The analytical solution of the gravity potential is easily obtained as the sum of the ones for a pure exponential function (like the one in equation \ref{eq:density-exp}) and for an homogeneous spherical shell.

We have performed this test also with a thin and a thick shell of 1 km and 35 km, respectively, without applying the density-based discretization algorithm.
On both cases, the constant $b$ is equal to the thickness of the shell: 1km for the thin shell and 35km for the thick one.
The results can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:D-exp-thin} and \ref{fig:D-exp-thick}.
Once again, we exclude the ones corresponding to $g_{xx}$ and $g_{yy}$ due to their similarity with the ones obtained for $g_{zz}$, although they can be found in the repository.

\begin{figure}

If the difference is less than 0.1\%, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.
}
\label{fig:D-exp-thin}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/exponential-D-thick.pdf}
\caption{

If the difference is less than 0.1\%, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.
}
\label{fig:D-exp-thick}
\end{figure}

In the same way we analysed the linear density results, we can summarise that the thin spherical shell presents the more conservative values of the distance-size ratio: $D=1$ for the gravity potential, $D=2$ for its gradient components and $D=8$ for the Marussi tensor components.

Moreover, we can see that the differences for the potential and the $g_z$ component of the gradient keep constant even for high values of $D$.
Our interpretation is that the modified adaptive discretization algorithm is limited when increasing the accuracy for this density function, supporting the need of a density-based discretization algorithm.

Because the constant $b$ controls the variation of the density function, we wanted to test how does the accuracy of the method behaves at different values of $b$ when the density-based discretization algorithm is not applied.
In order to do this we proposed a thin spherical shell (1km of thickness) with a set of density functions, each one with a different value of $b$.
We computed the difference between the Marussi tensor component $g_{zz}$ generated by the numerical model on the big grid of 30$^\circ\times$30$^\circ$ (see Table \ref{tab:grids}) and the corresponding analytical solution.
These differences were calculated for each proposed density function and for the same set of values of $D$ we have been using on the previous tests, obtaining one curve for each value of $b$.

On Figure \ref{fig:D-exp-power-thin}a we can see the density functions used to perform these tests and its corresponding results on \ref{fig:D-exp-power-thin}b .
Taking into account that lower values of $b$ implies a more varying function, we can see that for high varying functions the numerical model does not perform well: for $b=100$m the difference is almost 100\%.

We can conclude that even when the density-based discretization algorithm is not applied, the numerical approximation performs under the acceptable threshold for values of $b$ greater than the thickness of the shell, i.e. for low density variations.
On the other hand, a density-based discretization algorithm is needed in order to guarantee the accuracy of the approximation in case of a high varying density function.

If the difference is less than 0.1\%, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy.
}
\label{fig:D-exp-power-thin}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discontinuous Density}

As a final case, we performed the same test with a discontinuous density function:

\begin{equation}
    \rho(r') = 
    \begin{cases}
        \rho_A & \text{if} \, R_1 \leq r' < R_c \\
        \rho_B & \text{if} \, R_c \leq r' \leq R_2 \\
    \end{cases}
\label{eq:density-discontinuous}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\rho_A$ and $\rho_B$ are constant densities, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the inner and outer radii of the shell, respectively, and $R_c$ is the radius on which the density change takes place.

The analytical solution for this kind of density is a linear combination of two homogeneous shells with densities $\rho_A$ and $\rho_B$:

\begin{equation}
    V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \frac{\pi G}{r}
    \left[ \rho_A (R_c^3 - R_1^3) +
    \rho_B (R_2^3 - R_c^3) \right]
\end{equation}

Lets assume that $R_c = (R_1 + R_2)/3$ and perform the test for a thin shell of 1km of thickness without applying the density-based discretization algorithm.
Its results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:D-discont-asym}: up to $D=10$ the difference between the numerical model and the analytical solution is greater than 10\%, what leads us to conclude that a density-based discretization algorithm is needed in order to guarantee the accuracy of the model.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/discontinuous-D-asym.pdf}

If the difference is less than 0.1\%, we consider that the model has achieved an acceptable accuracy for the corresponding value of $D$.

\section{Determination of delta ratio}

In the light of the previous results, a density-based discretization algorithm is needed in order to achieve an acceptable accuracy in those cases on which the modified adaptive discretization algorithm is not sufficient to take into account the numerical error due to density variations.

Besides the implementation of this new algorithm, we must determine the maximum value of the delta ratio $\delta$ that produces an accuracy bellow a predefined threshold in order to guarantee the good performance of the numerical model.

To do this we applied a similar methodology used in the determination of the distance-size ratio $D$.
Using different values of $\delta$, ranging from 0.1 to 1 with a step of 0.1, we computed the potential, the $g_z$ component of the gradient and the $g_{zz}$ component of the Marussi tensor generated by a spherical shell with several exponential densities (like the one in equation \ref{eq:density-exp}): each one with a different value of $b$.
We performed this tests for a thin and a thick spherical shell of 1km and 35km of thickness, respectively.

Figures \ref{fig:exponential-delta-thin}a and \ref{fig:exponential-delta-thick}a show the exponential density functions used on each test for a thin and thick spherical shell, respectively.
While on Figures \ref{fig:exponential-delta-thin}b and \ref{fig:exponential-delta-thin}b we can see the differences between the resulting $g_{zz}$ with the corresponding analytical solution.
The results for the other gravity fields were excluded from the figures due to their similarities with the ones for $g_{zz}$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/exponential-delta-thin.pdf}
\caption{
    Results of the delta ratio determination, applied to a thin spherical shell (1km of thickness) with various exponential density functions, each one with different value of $b$.

    (b) Differences between the $g_{zz}$ component of the Marussi tensor generated by the numerical model and its corresponding analytical solution for several values of $\delta$ and $b$.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/exponential-delta-thick.pdf}

    (b) Differences between the $g_{zz}$ component of the Marussi tensor generated by the numerical model and its corresponding analytical solution for several values of $\delta$ and $b$.}
\label{fig:exponential-delta-thick}
\end{figure}

In the thin shell case we can conclude that a delta equal to 0.3 guarantees an acceptable accuracy under 0.1\% for the entire set of the density functions, while the thick shell case needs at least a delta equal to 0.2.
We will keep the more conservative value of 0.2 as the default value of delta on future computations.

Furthermore, we computed the difference between the numerical model and the analytical solution in case of a discontinuous density (as the one in equation \ref{eq:density-discontinuous} with $R_c = (R_1 + R_2)/3$) using a $\delta = 0.2$.
The result for the $g_{zz}$ component of the Marussi tensor is bellow the 0.1\% threshold, achieving a good performance for this default value of $\delta$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Speed Comparison}

We have recorded the computation times for the gravity potential, the gradient component $g_z$ and the Marussi tensor component $g_{zz}$ generated by a single tesseroid model ($35$km of thickness) with homogeneous, linear and exponential density (with $b=50$km) at different heights. Then we calculated the ratio between these computation times:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Computation Times Ratio} =
        \frac{\Delta t_\text{variable}}{\Delta t_\text{homogeneous}},
    \label{eq:computation-times-ratio}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta t_\text{homogeneous}$ and $\Delta t_\text{variable}$ are the computation times corresponding to the homogeneous model and to the variable density ones (linear and exponential).

On Figures \ref{fig:speed-comparison}a and \ref{fig:speed-comparison}b we can see the results of these comparison.
In the linear density case the density-based discretization algorithm is not applied because the inequation \ref{eq:delta-density} is never satisfied.
For this reason, the homogeneous density model is up to 5 times faster than the variable density one in this case.
On the other hand, the density-based discretization algorithm makes the computation slower: up to 20 times slower than the homogeneous density code.
Nevertheless, this increase in the computation time pays off with a guarantee\todo{guarantee is a noun?} on its accuracy.

\begin{figure}

\section{Example with real data}

Besides all the tests we have carried out on the new code, we intend to show a forward modelling example with real data.
In order to do that we have chosen the Neuqu\'en Basin: a sedimentary basin located to the east of the Andes, between 32$^\circ$S and 40$^\circ$S latitude (see Figure \ref{fig:neuquen-basin}a), that includes continental and marine siliciclastics, carbonates and evaporites accumulated over the Jurassic and the Cretaceous constituting a stratigraphic record up to 5000m of depth \citep{Howell2005}.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/neuquen-basin.pdf}
\caption{
         Forward model example with real data: Nequ\'en sedimentary modelled through tesseroids with exponential density.
         (a) Topography of Neuqu\'en Basin (in km),
         (b) Thickness of the sedimentary basin (in meters),
         (c)-(h) Computed gravity fields: potential $V$ (in J/kg), gradient components $g_x$, $g_y$ and $g_z$ (in mGal) and Marussi tensor components $g_{xy}$ and $g_{zz}$ (in Eötvös), calculated at 50km of height over the ellipsoid.}
\label{fig:neuquen-basin}
\end{figure*}

The thickness of the sediment pack was obtained from \citet{Heine2007}.
We managed to produce a regular grid with a resolution of 0.05$^\circ$ on both longitude and latitude directions with one value of thickness on each node (see Figure \ref{fig:neuquen-basin}b).

In order to compute the gravity fields generated by this basin we created a mesh of tesseroids, each one located on one of the nodes of the grid, with dimensions of 0.05$^\circ$ $\times$ 0.05$^\circ$ and depth equal to the thickness of the basin on the corresponding node.

We must also define a density function for the entire model.
\citet{Sigismondi2012} proposed a minimum and maximum density contrast for the Neuqu\'en basin of -412kg/m$^3$ and -275kg/m$^3$, respectively. \todo{ver que esos valores son de contraste y tienen q ir negativos. poner los valores absolutos.}
So we have chosen, for this specific example, an exponential density (like the one in equation \ref{eq:density-exp}) that assumes the minimum value on the surface and the maximum at 5858m, i.e. the bottom of the basin, with a value of $b$ equal to 3km.

We have finally computed the gravity potential $V$, the gradient components $g_x$, $g_y$ and $g_z$, and the Marussi tensor components $g_{xy}$ and $g_{zz}$ on a computation grid of 159$\times$163 nodes with a 0.05$^\circ$ spacing on both longitude and latitude directions at a 50km height over the reference ellipsoid.
The resulting gravity fields can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:neuquen-basin}c-h.
We have excluded the other components of the Marussi tensor from the Figure, although they can be found in the repository.

\section{Conclusions}

We have developed a Python library that allows us to perform forward gravity computations using tesseroids with variable density in depth.
The code numerically approximates the integral that defines the gravity potential, its gradient and the Marussi tensor through the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature (GLQ).
It essentially consists in approximating the gravity fields of the tesseroids with the effect of point masses located on the scaled nodes of the Legendre polynomials.
We state that this method it's well suited to approximate the effect of tesseroids with arbitrary densities, in contrast with the ones that involve Taylor series expansion.

Instead of enhancing the accuracy of the method by increasing the order of the GLQ on each integration, we make use of the preexisting modified adaptive discretization algorithm and a new density-based discretization algodithm.

The former one divides the tesseroid by half if the ratio of the distance to the computation point and its size is lower than a predefined distance-size ratio $D$.
We can summarise that $D$ controls the accuracy of the method: a higher value of $D$ generates more divisions of the tesseroids, thus more point masses, what leads to a more precise approximation.
Nevertheless it is not sufficient to guarantee the accuracy of the method in case of specific density functions as a highly variable exponential or some discontinuous functions.

For this reason we developed a density-based discretization algorithm that divides the tesseroid on the radius at which the \emph{maximum variation} of the density function takes place, only if a certain inequation that relates this \emph{maximum variation} with a predefined delta ratio $\delta$ holds.
Therefore the number of subdivisions is indirectly controlled by this delta ratio $\delta$, and thus the accuracy of the computation.

Because there is no direct relation between the values assigned to $D$ and $\delta$ and the error of the computation, we had to empirically determine the minimum value of $D$ and the maximum value of $\delta$ that produce an acceptable accuracy for each gravity field.

The distance-size ratio determinations have been made through the comparison of the numerical approximations with the analytical solutions for a spherical shell with variable density, which had to be analytically obtained.
These tests have been made without applying the density-based discretization algorithm in order to isolate the former one.
From the wide range of possible density variations, we've chosen a linear, an exponential and a discontinuous density functions.
The comparisons over the first two functions have shown that values of $D$ equal to 1, 2 and 8 for the calculation of the gravity potential, its gradient and the Marussi tensor components, respectively, produce an accuracy of 0.1\% or better.
On the other hand, the algorithm on its own does not guarantee this amount of accuracy in case of highly varying exponential functions or discontinuous densities.

We have performed similar tests for the density-based discretization algorithm comparing the numerical model with the analytical solutions for a spherical shell with various exponential densities: from low to high varying functions.
Each comparison was made for different values of $\delta$, keeping the default values of $D$ previously obtained.
This tests have shown that a value of $\delta = 0.2$ guarantees an accuracy of 0.1\% or better on every case, while the same results can be obtained performing this tests with the discontinuous density function.
The default value $\delta$ is the same for every gravity field computation.

Moreover, we had performed speed comparisons between tesseroids models with homogeneous and variable densities, showing that a high varying density function requires more computation time than a low varying one, as expected.

Finally, we have shown a real data example: we have computed the gravity fields generated by the Neuqu\'en sedimentary basin through a tesseroid model with exponential density with depth on a regular grid at 50km height.
